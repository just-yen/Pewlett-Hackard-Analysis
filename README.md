# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview: The Silver Tsunami 
Bobby has come to me for help. Their manager has discovered that there will be a wave of current employees reaching reitrement age soon and requires Bobby to provide two pieces of analysis. 

1) The number of retiring employees per title 
2) Identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program

The purpose of this repository is to provide Bobby the infromation and code to extract the data points needed for analysis. 

## Results 

- Senior Engineer (29414 count) and Senior Staff (28254 count) are the most urgent roles in need of replacing during the Silver Tsunami 
- Top 3 most available for mentorship by title are Engineer (592), Senior Staff (577), and Staff (327) 
- Senior Engineer is most at risk during the Silver Tsunami. There are only 250 Senior Engineers who are mentorship eligible of a 29,414 project retirement count. 

  ![Mentorship eligible count](https://github.com/just-yen/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Resources/mentorship_eligibility%20count.PNG).

- Senior roles make up 64% of the upcomming Silver Tsunami. This should be a point of urgency for the company.

### Identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program
The count of employees who are eligible for mentorship count are Engineers (592), Senior Staff (577), Staff (327), Senior Engineer (250), Technique Leader (250), and Assistant Engineer (95). 

  ![Mentorship eligible count](https://github.com/just-yen/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Resources/mentorship_eligibility%20count.PNG).

Due to a projected gap of retiring Senior Engineers and available Senior Engineers that are mentorship eligible. There may need to be an acceleration program implemented that will allow internal promotion of Engineers to the Senior Engineer role and Assistant Engineers into the Engineer role.
